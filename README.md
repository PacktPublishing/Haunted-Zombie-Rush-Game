Features coroutine-driven rock obstacles which the zombie (pc) must avoid. This section teaches the basics of developing in Unity. It provides students with the opportunity to work with 3D models, learn about what colliders and Rigidbodies do, and how to effectively use two very important functions in the Unity game loop, Update() and FixedUpdate(). Itâ€™s a great way to start learning by developing a fully-functional game.
